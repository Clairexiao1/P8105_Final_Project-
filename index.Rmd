## **About the Project** 

Michelin stars are what every chef is looking for! Even the most renowned chefs will be worried about losing stars, and even cry after losing one or two stars. However, the majority of chefs are devoting their lives just for one star. It is obvious that Michelin stars are important for chefs, but the controversies around this guide always exist. 

In this project, we want to explore more about the Michelin Restaurant around the world, and more specifically, what are these high-rated restaurants' features and how they are distributed around the world.

## **Website Overview**   

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the first part of our project. We want to explore our current dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/jackywang529/michelin-restaurants] retrieved from Kaggle. We want to get a general sense of Michelin Restaurants' price, location and cuisine type.  

2. Cuisine Types and Michelin Stars   
   
Michelin starts are awarded to restaurants judged to be of a particularly high standard. Eateries that make the grade can be awarded on, two three stars. Second part of our project focused on Michelin cuisine types and star ratings. We are curious about whether certain cuisine types usually have higher ranking in Michelin Star? 

3. Cuisine Type and their Prices

Following part two, we want to further investigate on the prices of Michelin Stars. Are certain cuisine associated with higher prices? In addition, do the prices varies by the continent? Let's find out!


4. Interactive Heat Map 

Last but not least, we utilized latitude & longitude information in our dataset to give you a direct, interactive heat map showing the distribution of the Michelin Restaurants around the world. You can filter your own variable of interest like: Michelin Star Rating, Continent and Cuisine Type to find the Michelin Restaurant that you are looking for!
