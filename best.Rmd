**Welcome to the World of Fine Dining**!

## **Three-star Restaurants**

&nbsp;

First, we want to take a look at the 133 three-star Michelin restaurants in the world.

By definition, Three MICHELIN Stars means "Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey!"

&nbsp;

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
three_df %>%
  count(country, sort = TRUE) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(Country = country, Count = n) %>%
  select(Country, Count) %>%
  knitr::kable()

three_df %>%
  count(country, sort = TRUE) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(count = n) %>%
  mutate(
    country = factor(country),
    country = fct_reorder(country, count)
  ) %>% 
 plot_ly(
      y = ~count, x = ~country, color = ~country,
      type = "bar", colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Country"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Michelin Restaurants")
)
```

7 countries own more than 10 three-star restaurants: **France, Japan, China, United States, Italy, Spain, Germany**.

&nbsp;

## **Which one is the Best?**

Since the Michelin Guide itself does not rank restaurants, how can we find the best
restaurant in the world.

&nbsp;

### Step 1: Overlap between rankings

Another famous restaurant ranking is The World's 50 Best Restaurants. We want to see which restaurant can be awarded three-star and Best 50 simultaneously. The assumption for this approach is that when a restaurant is acknowledged by multiple rankings, it is more likely that the restaurant provides almost the best food.

```{r warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
double_best = 
  inner_join(three_df, best50_df, by = "restaurants") %>%
  mutate(country = country.x) %>%
  select(-country.x, -country.y)

double_best %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Only **15** restaurants can be three-star and Best 50 at the same time in the world!
However, our goal is to find the best although they are all excellent restaurants.

&nbsp;

### Step 2: Award history

Another thing that is critical for a restaurant in the stability. The quality of food is determined by multiple factors - supply chain, staff, and the most important, chef. Sometimes, the ranking of a restaurant is largely dependent on the chef. The fame is for the chef, but not for the restaurant itself. Here, we want to find a restaurant that provide high-quality food in a stable way.

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
double_best %>%
  arrange(awarded_since) %>%
  select(country, restaurants, awarded_since) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

From the above table, we can see only one restaurant is awarded three-star since the last century, and it is also within Best 50 this year.

&nbsp;

### Best in NYC

It is hard for us to go to France to enjoy the best food in the world due to Covid-19. Fortunately, there is an absolutely excellent restaurant here in NYC.

**Le Bernardin**, three-star and Best 50, is awarded 3-star since 2006. Most importantly,
it is in 155 W 51st, very close to Columbia!

You can find their website here: [Le Bernardin](https://www.le-bernardin.com/home).
